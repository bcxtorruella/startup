### GitHub: 
commit often and don't mix up who works on what task. Fixing branches down the road is a headache
Fetch = refresh
Add is local staging, commit is save, and push is upload

### SSH 
from folder containing key, do:
`ssh -i production.pem ubuntu@3.209.168.176`
3.209.168.176 is the elastic IP
